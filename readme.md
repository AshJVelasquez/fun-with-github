<h1>Welcome to Ashley's Repo for Github User Search</h1>
<p>For this Mintbean Careerhack, our project needed to use Github's API to develop a website. My aproject's goal is to show the first 10 result of a user's search query.</p>
<h3>Things I learned:</h3>
<ul>
<li>RESTful APIs: Getting more familiar with them. Postman is so helpful!</li>
<li>jQuery: This was my first time using it in my code.</li>
<li>Ajax: Another JS first! I seen my MSTA instructor use it, so it was familiar. It's different seeing it work from MY use though!</li>
</ul>
